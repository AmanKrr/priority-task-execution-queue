# priority-task-execution-queue
A highly efficient, flexible queue system for managing the execution of asynchronous tasks with customizable priorities, retries, and timeouts. Designed for use in JavaScript/TypeScript applications, this library helps you manage concurrency, schedule tasks, and control execution flow with ease.

## Features:

1. **Task Prioritization**: Execute tasks based on priority levels (lower values indicate higher priority).
2. **Concurrency Control**: Limit the number of tasks running simultaneously.
3. **Retries & Timeouts**: Automatically retry tasks on failure with optional timeout settings.
4. **Pause & Resume**: Manage the queue state with pause and resume functionality.
5. **Task Cancellation**: Cancel tasks or adjust their priority dynamically while they're queued.

Ideal for applications requiring optimized task scheduling, function execution, and management of asynchronous operations.
